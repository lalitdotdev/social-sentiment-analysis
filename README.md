## Introduction

Human language processing involves two essential components: understanding and generation. In the vast landscape of natural language processing, this project focuses on sentiment analysis and social network analysis. Sentiment analysis evaluates data as positive, negative, or neutral, while social network analysis unveils patterns in user interactions and network structures.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Explore the sentiment expressed in textual content using state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models.
- **Social Network Analysis:** Uncover patterns in user interactions, influential nodes, and network structures through graph-based representations and visualizations.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare massive Twitter datasets for analysis through meticulous preprocessing techniques.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-network-analysis.git
cd social-network-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Run sentiment analysis and social network analysis scripts to explore the project functionalities.

```
python sentiment_analysis.py
python social_network_analysis.py
```

## Data Preprocessing

The first phase involves preprocessing a substantial Twitter dataset containing 1.6 million tweets. The data undergoes transformations, including lowercasing, URL and punctuation removal, and stemming, to prepare it for sentiment analysis.

## Sentiment Analysis

State-of-the-art machine learning models like Naive Bayes and advanced deep learning models such as BERT are employed for sentiment analysis. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, provide a comprehensive understanding of model performance.

## Social Network Analysis

Graph-based representations and visualizations are utilized to depict network dynamics, fostering a deeper comprehension of relationships within the social graph. Explore influential nodes, user interactions, and overall network structures.

## Results

The project yields detailed insights and visualizations showcasing sentiment distribution and social network patterns. These results provide valuable information for understanding user behavior and community dynamics.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of sentiment analysis models using standard metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and classification reports enhance interpretability and provide a comprehensive view of model performance.

## Future Improvements

As the project evolves, consider the following future improvements:

- Incorporate advanced deep learning models, such as BERT, for more nuanced sentiment analysis.
- Explore cutting-edge machine learning techniques for social network analysis.

## Challenges

Addressing challenges such as contextual nuances in sentiment analysis and diverse emotional expressions in social network analysis is imperative. Standardizing rules for expressing feelings across platforms remains a challenge due to varied communication styles.
